Help me create a good markdown document that can be used as input to generate a python application to read obd 2 input from a Power2 diagnostic scanner. The application will need to display live data as well read stored codes.

Use DefineApp.md as input but do not update DefineApp.md document. Create a new file with your results and include the name of the agent and model in the file name.

Only use this file. Do not use any other files in this folder. Only read this file.
